# pace-offset

Garmin Connect IQ data field showing how many seconds ahead of pace or behind
pace you are. Pick your target pace in the data field settings, then try to
stick to that pace by keeping the offset at 0. A negative offset means that
you're ahead of pace by that many seconds, and a positive offset means that
you're behind pace.

Does not account for hills.
